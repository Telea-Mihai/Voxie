## 10/31/2025 - Setting up the groundwork  

Soo, this will be my first raspberry pi project. I will be using a raspberry pi 5 in conjuction with an arduino because of its analog capabilities. 

I will be using a MAX4466 microphone for the input, a arduino uno, a generic amplifier and generic speaker driver. 

I am planning to also use a webcam (maybe) to add vision to this house assistant. Then using esp32's make children devices that can be activated using voice commands. 

Googles Gemini will be the brain of the operation because of it ease of use, huge token budget and small small price of free. (also it has google search and stuff that are easy to integrate). For STT and TTS I haven't decided yet, but either way the raspberry pi 5 should be up to the task.

For the project itself I have set up the raspberry pi, with which I had some difficulties, as I only worked with arduino and esp32's before. Then after setting it up with ssh and visual studio, I made a little app where I can connect a webcam to the pi and see it's output in a web interface. 

As my next objective I have recording audio using the MAX4466 microphone.![WIN_20251031_16_44_27_Pro](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njk4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--647d019695adaba35fce1b8052617c263553e7bc/WIN_20251031_16_44_27_Pro.jpg)
  

## 11/1/2025 - Making a mic circuit  

So, after the experiments yesterday, I got started on working on the microphone. As I said I am using a Max4466 mic. The problem was noise and DC offset (2.5V in this case).

For this I made a simple filter using a recycled capacitor from an old and broken arduino and some resistors and solved the dc offset issue. 

For the noise, since I didn't have any small caps, I relied on software filters. Basically oversampling and averaging values to get rid of artifacts and noise

(this is me doing a constant tone in the mic)

Also in order to prepare for the next step which will be recording actual audio, all audio files work at around 16bit and 16khz samples. So for that some additional processing is done on the arduino in order to convert from the 10bit it can read from the analog pins. 

All of this means when Idle the analog read hovers at around +- 2500, which is very good considering it's not completely silent (my laptop fans are spinning) and the as an idea the values are between -32768 (-512 * 64) so I can proudly say I got a nice mic circuit going, and the next step will be actually processing the samples and creating actual audio files.
