## 10/31/2025 - Setting up the groundwork  

Soo, this will be my first raspberry pi project. I will be using a raspberry pi 5 in conjuction with an arduino because of its analog capabilities. 

I will be using a MAX4466 microphone for the input, a arduino uno, a generic amplifier and generic speaker driver. 

I am planning to also use a webcam (maybe) to add vision to this house assistant. Then using esp32's make children devices that can be activated using voice commands. 

Googles Gemini will be the brain of the operation because of it ease of use, huge token budget and small small price of free. (also it has google search and stuff that are easy to integrate). For STT and TTS I haven't decided yet, but either way the raspberry pi 5 should be up to the task.

For the project itself I have set up the raspberry pi, with which I had some difficulties, as I only worked with arduino and esp32's before. Then after setting it up with ssh and visual studio, I made a little app where I can connect a webcam to the pi and see it's output in a web interface. 

As my next objective I have recording audio using the MAX4466 microphone.![WIN_20251031_16_44_27_Pro](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njk4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--647d019695adaba35fce1b8052617c263553e7bc/WIN_20251031_16_44_27_Pro.jpg)
